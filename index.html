                        find a a good place abroad for us to go outside of France, so we decided for Arcachon, hoping
                        for some sunny day, despite knowing it wouldn't be that hot. In the way, we passed thru
                        Boradeaux, which gave you some good feelings about your parents first trip after they've got
                        married. In Arcachon, we went to Al Mounia, my first time in a Moroccan restaurant. You didn't
                        approve the food hhh, and later we came to know about news of problems with Moroccan clients
                        there, so it was a polemic place. Sadly you felt bad while we were there, but we were lucky to
                        be staying in a hotel with very nice owners, they helped us to find medication for you, giving
                        me a ride and taking me through the cities nearby in search of a open pharmacy. After that we
                        went to La Dune du Pilat and you were very strong on that day, hanging on even feeling not well.
                        We thought we would lose the bus, so we ran and ran, but in the end it was fine.</p>

                        We walked thru the walls, saw many shops, ate bretonne cookies, sat on the beach to have our

                        Surprisingly we got a very nice day, because it seemed it would be cold and windy, but the sun
                        came out and we could see a very blue ocean while sharing moments with the girls.</p>

                        The walks thru Valetta, the swimming in the lagoons, the kayak together, sharing the effort

                        that. I love you. You're the most important person in my life. And seeing all of
                        this we lived, I'm sure that, inshallah, there's a lot more good things for us to live, to share, to build,
                        to see, to feel together. So let's keep going, let's continue walking, being support and taking care
